** **Deployment Instructions
+Environment Setup: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Set up the Hardhat project with npm init and npm install --save-dev hardhat.
+Compile the Contract: Run npx hardhat compile to compile Pepe42Token.sol.
+Deploy to Test Network: Use the provided script deploy_script.js with npx hardhat run scripts/deploy_script.js --network rinkeby.
+Verify on Etherscan: After deployment, verify the contract on Etherscan for the Rinkeby testnet by following Etherscan's verification process.
+Interacting with the Token : Interact with $PEPE42 using Hardhat console or scripts. For example, to transfer tokens, use ethers.js to invoke the transfer method on the deployed contract.

** **Security Features
+Ownership: Only the contract owner can mint or burn tokens, preventing unauthorized token creation or destruction.
+ERC-20 Compliance: Adheres to the ERC-20 standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of wallets and exchanges.
+Further Development: Future enhancements could include adding a governance model, implementing a staking mechanism, or integrating with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.
