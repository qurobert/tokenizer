# Technical Specification for PEPE42 Token

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed technical overview of the PEPE42 token, outlining its functionality, compliance with the ERC-20 standard, and the rationale behind its design and features.

## ERC-20 Compliance

PEPE42 adheres to the ERC-20 standard, ensuring compatibility with the Ethereum ecosystem. This section breaks down the standard functions and events implemented in the PEPE42 token contract.

### Functions

- `transfer`: Allows token holders to transfer tokens to another account.
- `approve`: Enables a spender to withdraw up to an approved amount.
- `transferFrom`: Allows a spender to transfer tokens on behalf of the token owner.
- `balanceOf`: Returns the token balance of a specific account.
- `allowance`: Returns the remaining number of tokens that a spender is allowed to spend from an owner's account.
- `burn`: Allows token holders to brun their tokens.
- `burnFrom`: Allows the burn of specific token holder by the contract owner.
- `mint`: Allows contract holder to mint new tokens (here the multisig of  2/2).
- `transferOwnership`: Allows contract owner to transfer the ownership of the contract.

### Events

- `Transfer`: Emitted when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.
- `Approval`: Emitted when a successful approval is made via the `approve` function.

## Minting and Burning

- **Minting**: The contract owner can create new tokens, adding to the total supply.
- **Burning**: Token holders or the contract owner can destroy their tokens, reducing the total supply.

## Ownership and Security

The PEPE42 contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` pattern to restrict certain actions, such as minting new tokens, to the contract owner, enhancing security and control.

## Conclusion

PEPE42's technical design is crafted to balance flexibility, security, and compliance with the ERC-20 standard, supporting a wide range of use cases within the Ethereum ecosystem.
